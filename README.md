SUMMARY: This is a command line-based app that scrapes websites to reveal the current contract status of Major Baseball League free-agent players, then displays the players by team, showing for each team whether the player signed was a re-signing or a new acquisition.

CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY: From the command line, if you run the Ruby file, agent_scraper.rb, you will see the output in your browser.

FUTURE FEATURES: (i) Provide additional ways to sort the players and teams, (ii) eliminate the command line component, (iii) improve user interface.
